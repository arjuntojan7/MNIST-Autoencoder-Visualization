#  MNIST Autoencoder with 3D Latent Space Visualization

This project demonstrates how to build and train an **autoencoder neural network** on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. The model compresses 28Ã—28 pixel images of handwritten digits into a **3-dimensional latent space**, and then reconstructs them. The 3D latent features are visualized using **t-SNE** and **Plotly** to explore how different digit classes cluster in this reduced space.
